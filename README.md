## Summary:

| SUBJECT                               | DESCRIPTION                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Algorithms and Programming Basics     | The theoretical basics of algorithms, flowcharts, pseudo codes and programming. Useful to understand what does problem solving, logical thinking and programming actually mean. |
| Cryptography Notes                    | Contains from ground up the basics of cryptography and cryptanalysis. Notes are updated regularly and are not complete. These notes are detailed and contains all the important techniques a beginner should learn. |
| Data Structure Operational Complexity | Contains a cheat-sheet which details complexity of basic data structures and basic operations performed on them. |
|                                       |                                                              |
| Digital Forensics Basics              | Theoretical basics of Digital Forensics. Contains guidelines and basic step a digital forensic examiner should take while examining. |
| Markdown                              | Contains notes on basic Markdown syntax. Markdown is a viable option for writing proper structured files, readmes, educational notes for students of Computer Science. |
|                                       |                                                              |
| RSA Key Generation Algorithm          | Contains a cheat-sheet for the the RSA key generation algorithm. |
