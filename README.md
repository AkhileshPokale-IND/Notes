## Summary

| **SUBJECT**                                                  | **DESCRIPTION**                                              |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Algorithms and Programming Basics](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/Algorithm_Basics_Notes/Algorithm_Basics_Notes.pdf) | The theoretical basics of algorithms, flowcharts, pseudo codes and programming. Useful to understand what does problem solving, logical thinking and programming actually mean. Programs are available [here](https://github.com/datta-agni/Java-Codes "here"). |
| [Cryptography Notes](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/Cryptography_Notes/Cryptography_Notes.pdf) | From the roots up, this manuscript covers the fundamentals of cryptology. Notes are continuously updated, but they're far from being completed. Together, all key methods a learner should grasp will be included in these notes. |
| [Data Structure Operational Complexity](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/DS_Basic_Complexity_Notes/DS_Basic_Complexity_Notes.pdf) | Data structures and the operations performed around them are illustrated in matrix format in this reference sheet. |
| [Data Structure Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/DS_Sorting_Algorithms_Notes/DS_Sorting_Algorithms_Notes.pdf) | Contains detailed notes and codes on a few basic Sorting Algorithms. |
| [Digital Forensics Basics](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/Digital_Forensic_Basics_Notes/Digital_Forensic_Basics_Notes.pdf) | Introduction to Digital Forensics theories Within that manuscript, you'll find guidelines and fundamental procedures that a digital investigator ought to follow while examining. |
| [Markdown Syntax](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/Markdown_Syntax_Notes/Markdown_Syntax_Notes.pdf) | Notes on essential Markdown syntax are included. Markdown has become a plausible choice for students and professionals alike to write properly formatted documents, readme files, or academic notes. |
| [RSA Key Generation Algorithm](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/RSA_Key_Generation_Algorithm_Notes/RSA_Key_Generation_Algorithm_Notes.pdf) | Contains a cheat-sheet for the the RSA key generation algorithm. |
| [System Architecture](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/System_Architechtures_Notes/System_Architechtures_Notes.pdf) | In this manuscript, you'll find notes on Computer Architecture from university lectures and various reference books. |
