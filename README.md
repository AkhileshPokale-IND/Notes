## Summary:

| SUBJECT                                   | DESCRIPTION                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Introduction To Algorithm and Programming | The theoretical basics of algorithms, flowcharts, pseudo codes and programming. Useful to understand what does problem solving, logical thinking and programming actually mean. |
| Digital Forensics                         | Theoretical basics of Digital Forensics. Contains guidelines and basic step a digital forensic examiner should take while examining. |
| Markdown                                  | Contains notes on basic Markdown syntax. Markdown is a viable option for writing proper structured files, readmes, educational notes for students of Computer Science. |
| RSA Key Generation Algorithm              | Contains a cheat-sheet for the the RSA key generation algorithm. |
