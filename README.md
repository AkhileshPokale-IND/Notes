## Summary:

| SUBJECT                                                      | DESCRIPTION                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Algorithms and Programming Basics](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/Algorithm_Basics_Notes/Algorithm_Basics_Notes.tex) | The theoretical basics of algorithms, flowcharts, pseudo codes and programming. Useful to understand what does problem solving, logical thinking and programming actually mean. Codes and Programs are available [here](https://github.com/datta-agni/Java-Codes 'here'). |
| [Cryptography Notes](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/Cryptography_Notes/Cryptography_Notes.tex) | Contains from ground up the basics of cryptography and cryptanalysis. Notes are updated regularly and are not complete. These notes are detailed and contains all the important techniques a beginner should learn. |
| [Data Structure Operational Complexity](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/DS_Basic_Complexity_Notes/DS_Basic_Complexity_Notes.tex) | Contains a cheat-sheet which details complexity of basic data structures and basic operations performed on them. |
| [Data Structure Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/DS_Sorting_Algorithms_Notes/DS_Sorting_Algorithms_Notes.md) | Contains detailed notes and code on a few basic Sorting Algorithms. |
| [Digital Forensics Basics](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/Digital_Forensic_Basics_Notes/Digital_Forensic_Basics_Notes.tex) | Theoretical basics of Digital Forensics. Contains guidelines and basic step a digital forensic examiner should take while examining. |
| [Markdown Syntax](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/Markdown_Syntax_Notes/Markdown_Syntax_Notes.tex) | Contains notes on basic Markdown syntax. Markdown is a viable option for writing proper structured files, readmes, educational notes for students of Computer Science. |
| [RSA Key Generation Algorithm](https://github.com/datta-agni/Notes/blob/main/RSA_Key_Generation_Algorithm_Notes/RSA_Key_Generation_Algorithm_Notes.tex) | Contains a cheat-sheet for the the RSA key generation algorithm. |
