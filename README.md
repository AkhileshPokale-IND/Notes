## Summary:

| SUBJECT                                | DESCRIPTION                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Introduction Algorithm and Programming | Theory of problem solving through implementation of algorithms. |
| Digital Forensics                      | Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. |
| Markdown                               | Contains notes on basic Markdown syntax. Markdown is a viable option for writing proper structured files, readmes, educational notes for students of Computer Science. |
| RSA                                    | RSA is a asymmetric public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. |
